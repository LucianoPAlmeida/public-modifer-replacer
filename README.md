# [WIP] modifier-remover

Project 423 `'public' modifier is redundant for instance method declared in a public extension` warnings.  So, no way we are going to remove it by hand.

TODO: 
* Handle multiple swift files in a directory.
* Fix the issue where the public is removed but it also is removing the tab and new line.
